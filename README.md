# Pokémon Files

JavaScript/TypeScript library for reading and writing Pokémon binary files (`.pkm`, `.pk9`, etc).

The classes in this library are TypeScript implementations of the PKM source code in the [PKHeX](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX) project. This library would not exist without the research done by the PKHeX developers.
